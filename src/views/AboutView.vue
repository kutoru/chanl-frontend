  <h1>About</h1>
  <span>osu! is a popular rhythm game that was initially released in 2007 by an Australian programmer named Dean "peppy" Herbert. The game is inspired by the Nintendo DS game Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan and has since gained a large and dedicated player base.
In osu!, players interact with the game by clicking, sliding, or holding notes that appear on the screen in sync with the rhythm of a song. The game features a wide range of musical genres, allowing players to enjoy different styles of music while challenging their reflexes and coordination.
The main gameplay mode in osu! is called "Standard," where players click circles, hold sliders, and spin spinners according to the beat of a song. There are also several other game modes available, including "Taiko," which simulates traditional Japanese drumming, "Catch the Beat," which requires players to catch fruit falling from the top of the screen, and "Mania," which is similar to popular rhythm games like Dance Dance Revolution or Beatmania.
osu! has a strong community aspect, with players creating and sharing their own beatmaps. A beatmap is a custom-designed level that defines the placement and timing of the notes in a song. This allows players to enjoy a virtually endless supply of new songs and challenges.
The game has gained a competitive scene with various tournaments and leaderboards, and it also has a strong presence in streaming platforms such as Twitch, where players showcase their skills and interact with viewers.
Overall, osu! is known for its challenging gameplay, diverse music selection, and active community, making it a popular choice for rhythm game enthusiasts around the world.</span>
